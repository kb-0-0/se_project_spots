# Project 3: Spots

This is a project in which we create a social media photo sharing platform. The object of this project is to create a responsive platform so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes, specifically desktop and mobile screen sizes.

The technology I used was a macbook. And in order to achieve the goals of this project, techniques used were using a mix, BEM methodology to create clear css structure, using grid and flexbox to achieve the layouts and responsiveness of the page.
